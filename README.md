## My Process

### Built with
HTML 5
CSS Custom properties

### What I learned
I learned alot of things while solving this challenge for example, how to center a div using position absolute:
```css
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```

### Continued development
I am not very well aware of the concepts of css grid and flex box which I will be learning soon.
